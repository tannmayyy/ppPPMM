Currently, I'm reviewing the repo shared by Gaurav. Since Gaurav has already worked on SOC and NAICS, I'm walking through that part for better understanding and will start working on it soon. In parallel, I received some comments from Gaurav on my previous commits—more as recommendations—so I plan to complete those changes today as well.
